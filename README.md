# AudioVariables

This simple audio player lets you select and loop a specific segment of an audio file with a customizable pause between repetitions. 
An optional count-in helps you prepare before playback starts.
Playback speed and pitch can be adjusted independently for flexible listening and practice.

Built with Xcode 26.2 and Swift version 6.2.
